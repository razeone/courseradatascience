# Lesson 1 Graphs
### Principles of Analytic Graphics

* Shows comparisons
	- Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis
	- Always ask "Compared to what?"
* Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
	- What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
* Show multivariate data
	- Multivariate = more than 2 variables
	- The real world is multivariate
	- Need to escape flatland
* Integration of evidence
	- Completely integrate  words, numbers, images, diagrams
	- Data graphics should makes use of any modes of data representation
	- Don't let the tool drives the analysis
* Describe and document the evidence with appropiate labels, scales, sources, etc
	- A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
* Content is king 
	- Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
