My First R Markdown File
========================

This is my first markdown file.

Here we're going to load some data

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make a plot

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's the regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature.

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data = airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list

Here's a quote
